## About

SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool. SchemaCrawler has a good mix of useful features for data governance. [SchemaCrawler is a Java API](https://dev.to/sualeh/how-to-get-database-metadata-as-java-pojos-24li) that makes working with database metadata as easy as working with plain old Java objects.

SchemaCrawler supports almost any database that has a JDBC driver, but for convenience is [bundled with drivers](https://www.schemacrawler.com/database-support.html) for some commonly used RDBMS systems. SchemaCrawler works with any operating system that supports Java SE 17 or better.

> This project is the core SchemaCrawler API and tool framework. Please look at [schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler](https://github.com/schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler) for multiple database support and tool implementations. These are described on the [SchemaCrawler website](https://www.schemacrawler.com/).
